I never imagined that I could be one of those people who could possibly change the world.  I didn't believe that I had what it took to create and build something from scratch, to watch it grow into something else, and see how it could positively effect the world around me.  That is, until I decided to learn how to code, and entered into this amazing program.  

Flatiron has created a way for me to not only change the trajectory of my career, but to do something that is fulfilling and challenging, which is software development.  My first initial reasoning for wanting to learn, was so that I could rebuild my app that I outsourced to other developers, who did a poor job.  Many days I struggled with understanding what they were doing on their end, there was a major language barrier ( as most of the developers where from India or Russia), a huge time difference, as well as the fact that they could care less about how the product would peform in the future, and only wanted to produce what they could get paid for immediately.

As a result, I decided to take action and learn how to build these softwares myself, not only to rebuild my product, but to build better products in the future.  No longer will I ever be in a position to get taken advantage of by anyone because of a lack of knowledge of this domain.  I am honored to be apart of such an amazing program that has given me the opportunity to gain the knowledge needed to create amazing things.
