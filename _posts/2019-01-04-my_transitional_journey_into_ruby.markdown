As a fellow July baby, I have a special place in my heart for Rubies.  With it's pink to blood-red colored gemstone, Rubies are amongst the rarest of gems througout the entire world.  It symbolizes passion and is said to bring love and success.

The same manner in which I admire this precious stone, I also admire the language of Ruby.  Yukihiro Matsumoto, the language creater, designed Ruby to be portable, simple, complete and extensible, and it works well across most platforms.  It's interpreted, object-oriented language has led to better structure and programs that are much easier to maintain.  I found that after coding in HTML and CSS for a brief time period, the transition back to the Ruby language was very simple.  In fact, it was quite welcoming.

Ruby has this way of putting code in language that is easy to read and iterate over, with it's clear and concise use of variable and method terminology.  It is a great baseline language because of it's simplicity in reading and writing methods, as well as a great starting point for those who are seeking a language that is easy to learn, in comparison to others like Java and Javascript.

An important thing to remember about learning any new language is making sure that you make it apart of your life.  You must embrace the long days, late hours, extra studying, researching, broken code, and many, many error messages.  Ruby is a great place to begin, and has proven to be a confidence booster for someone like me, who had no previous coding knowledge prior to becoming a student at Flatiron.  Although I am still learning the in's and out's of Ruby, I am positive this is a language I will dive deeper into to gain a more in-depth knowledge of in the future.
