<p>I am a graduate of the College of Charleston Business School.  Upon graduation, I founded a start-up and learned first-hand how difficult it is to be a non-technical person in this ever-growing technical world.  As a result, I enrolled in the Flatiron Schools Full-Stack Web Developer program in order to acquire skills that will enable me to reach my full potential.</p>
